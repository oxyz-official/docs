## Setting up

The Super AI $O$ , powering the [o.xyz](http://O.XYZ) AI Operating System, is poised to become the world's first open-source, community-owned **Super AI**. Leveraging the vast GPU compute power from [io.net](http://io.net/), it sets new benchmarks in AI capabilities and performance:

- **Unparalleled Computing Power**: Deployed on more than 270,000 GPUs
- **Extensive Model Library**: Access to 500,000+ open-source models capable of handling virtually any task at light speed.
- **Advanced Features**:
    - **Model-to-model routing for optimal / specialized task execution.**
        - This is the main core feature of the SuperAI: the intelligence to know to which model it should route the subtask, and how to handle the next hop to the next model.
    - Supported with access to massive library of confidential cloud functions
    - The platform hosts various hubs for models, agents, and APIs, creating a comprehensive ecosystem that empowers the Super AI $O$.
